    <h1>Silent Echoes</h1>
    <p> In silence, unspoken tales unfold, <br>

Eyes whisper secrets, bold and old,<br>

Hands speak in motions, stories told,<br>

In quiet, the greatest truths we hold.</p>

<p> Beyond the realm of spoken sound, <br>

In gestures, life’s rhythm is found,<br>

A nod, a smile, feelings abound,<br>

Where words are lost, silence is profound.</p>
<p>In each silent echo, a language deep, <br>

In every glance, promises we keep,<br>

In the quiet, our thoughts leap,<br>

In silence, our hearts speak. </p>

        Nobody’s born smart.<strong>We all start at 0</strong>.Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong> <em> This. is.learning </em> </strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <em>You can learn anything.</em>
